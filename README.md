1. First, the current port number is 4567. You will have to change the port number value to the microservice to match the port number in the UI.
2. Run the microservice.
3. write the name of an MLB team and it must all be capitalized.
4. The microservice will recieve the input. If the input was valid it will return a tcp message for all the World Series years that team has won. For invalid input the microservice will return an error message.

2. In order to request data the function "client.connect((theHostName, portNum))". This establishes the TCP socket connection.
3. The next function "sentInfo = input("Enter MLB Team name (CAPITALIZED): ")" this is how the UI grabs user input and saves that to sentInfo variable.
4. Lastly, the function "client.send(sentInfo.encode())", this encodes the user input and sends it to the microservice.
